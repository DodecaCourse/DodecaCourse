                Working through this course, you built a great foundation for your
                future ear training. You learned the basic concepts and have
                recognized why relating your ear training exercises to a
                tonic is so important.

            <p>
                Now it's important to get to your instrument and start to transfer
                the things you hear to your instrument, because playing what you

                corresponding key. Begin with the "Single Note" mode and start with short 2- or 3-note
                melodies, playing them on your instrument while singing (or thinking, if you're on a wind instrument)
                the corresponding solfège syllables. Don't forget to change the key from time to time, and you'll also
                get a free scale training out of it.
