                Congratulations! You've made it to the fifth and final module of this course!
            </p>
            <p>
                Having completed the first four you've done all the hard work. You've laid the foundation that all
                further ear training will be built upon.
            </p>
            <p>
                From here on in things get much easier.
            </p>
            <p>
                The next step is to continue consolidating on what you've learned and extending it by applying the
                principles you've learned to other scales and non-diatonic.
            </p>
            <p>
                This module contains all the exercises that you've used so far, but applied to the minor scale. As I'm
                sure you can imagine, it's huge so don't expect to complete it all at once. Simply work through it just
                as you did with the previous modules. You'll find it much easier to make progress than you did when you
                first started because of the experience you now have.
            </p>
            <p>
                So dive in and good luck!
            </p>
