            <h1>2. Recognising Individual Notes</h1>
            <h2>Internalisation</h2>
            <h3>Exercise Description</h3>
            <p>
                In this module there is an internalisation exercise for each scale
                degree. The scale degree that an internalisation exercise focuses on
                is called the target scale degree of the exercise.</p>
            <p>These exercises
                are just like the internalisation exercise from the first module. A
                <i>I - IV - V</i> progression is played for the first two bars, followed by 8
                bars with the tonic chord played in every second bar. However, the
                target scale degree is played in each bar instead of the tonic.</p>
            <p>You can see the
                first 10 bars from the internalisation exercise for the second scale
                degree "Re" below. In the key of C major, this is the note D.</p>

            <h3>How to use the individual note internalisation exercises</h3>
            <p>
                The approach to the individual note exercises is the same as it was
                in the previous module with one addition: when you sing the scale
                degree, hold it for a couple of seconds then sing the tonic. Then
                return to the target scale degree.</p>
            <p>If you can sing
                the tonic in this way it shows that you're recognising the tonic
                clearly so you're hearing the relationship between the tonic and the
                target scale degree.</p>
            <p>So the complete
                process is:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><p><b>Listen to the
                    <i>I - IV - V</i> Progression:</b> Simply listening to the <i>I - IV - V</i>
                    progression will make it clear to your ear which note is the tonic
                    (even if you can't identify which note it is yet). So just sit back
                    and listen.</p></li>
                <li><p><b>Focus your
                    attention on the target scale degree:</b> for the following 8 bars,
                    listen closely to the target scale degree. Listen to the way that it
                    sounds in relation to the tonic chord.</p></li>
                <li><p><b>Sing the
                    target scale degree:</b> alongside listening to the sound of the target
                    scale degree, singing it will help you to really hear and
                    internalise it's stable sound.</p></li>
                <li><p><b>Sing the
                    tonic:</b> after you sing the target scale degree for a couple of
                    seconds, sing the tonic to ensure you can recognise it accurately.</p></li>
                <li><p><b>Sing the
                    target scale degree again:</b> return to the target scale degree and
                    continue listening to the way that it sounds next to the tonic
                    chord.</p></li>
                <li><p><b>Repeat:</b> when
                    the <i>I - IV - V</i> progression is played in a new key, listen to the
                    progression as you did the first time. This will establish a new
                    note as the tonic and then you can repeat listening to/singing the
                    target scale degree in the new key.</p></li>
            </ol>
            <p>Practice
                with this exercise until you start to feel confident that you are
                internalising the sound of the target scale degree. Then try the
                internalisation test for the target scale degree.
            </p>
            <h3>Internalisation Tests</h3>
            <p>
                Each scale degree has an internalisation test that goes alongside
                it's internalisation exercise.</p>
            <p>The
                internalisation test for each scale degree is just like the
                internalisation test for the tonic from the first module. A <i>I - IV -V</i>
                progression is played for the first two bars, followed by a pause,
                and finally the target scale degree is played before the sequence is
                repeated in a new key.</p>
            <p>You can see the
                first 8 bars from the internalisation test for the second scale
                degree below.</p>
            <p>

            </p>
            <h3>How to use the individual note internalisation tests</h3>
            <p>
                In the internalisation tests in this module we'll add the additional
                step of singing the tonic, just as we did with the internalisation
                exercises.</p>
            <p>This creates two
                'difficulty levels' with the internalisation tests.</p>
            <h4>1. Sing the tonic</h4>
            <p>In this first
                'difficulty level', you'll sing the tonic before you attempt to sing
                the target scale degree. So you will:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><p><b>Listen to the
                    <i>I - IV - V</i> Progression:</b> Like with the internalisation exercises (and
                    all other exercises in the course) just listen to the <i>I - IV - V</i>
                    progression while it outlines the key.</p></li>
                <li><p><b>Listen for
                    the sound of the target scale degree and hear it clearly in your
                    head:</b> wait until the <i>I - IV - V</i> progression has been played and you
                    hear the tonic chord played again, then identify which note is the
                    tonic and hear it internally.</p></li>
                <li><p><b>Sing the
                    tonic:</b> sing the note you hear as the tonic in your head just as you
                    did in the tonic internalisation exercise.</p></li>
                <li><p><b>Try to hear
                    the sound of the target scale degree clearly in your head:</b> after
                    you've sung the tonic, try to hear the sound of the target scale
                    degree as clearly in your head as you can. You are repeating the
                    movement from the tonic to the target scale degree you've been
                    singing in the internalisation exercise so listen for that sound.</p></li>
                <li><p><b>Sing the
                    target scale degree:</b> if you can hear the target scale degree
                    internally, sing it. Then hold it or repeat it for the next few
                    second.</p></li>
                <li><p><b>Check that
                    you have sung the target scale degree correctly:</b> Listen to the
                    target scale degree when it is played to see if it's the same note
                    as the one you're singing.</p></li>
                <li><p><b>Repeat:</b> The
                    internalisation tests move through all 12 keys, so repeat this
                    process in each of them to see how well you've internalised the
                    sound of each scale degree.</p></li>
            </ol>
            <p>Once you can get
                10 out of 12 keys right at the first difficult level, you're ready to
                move onto the second one.</p>
            <h4>2. Don't sing the tonic</h4>
            <ol>
                <li><p><b>Listen to the
                    <i>I - IV - V</i> Progression:</b> Like with the internalisation exercises (and
                    all other exercises in the course) just listen to the <i>I - IV - V</i>
                    progression while it outlines the key.</p></li>
                <li><p><b>Listen for
                    the sound of the tonic and hear it clearly in your head:</b> wait until
                    the <i>I - IV - V</i> progression has been played and you hear the tonic
                    chord played again, then identify which note is the tonic and hear
                    it internally.</p></li>
                <li><p><b>Try to hear
                    the sound of the target scale degree clearly in your head:</b> once you
                    can hear the tonic clearly in your head, listen for the sound of the
                    target scale degree. You are listening for the same relationship,
                    but you simply haven't sung the tonic.</p></li>
                <li><p><b>Sing the
                    target scale degree:</b> if you can hear the target scale degree
                    internally, sing it. Then hold it or repeat it for the next few
                    second.</p></li>
                <li><p><b>Check that
                    you have sung the target scale degree correctly:</b> Listen to the
                    target scale degree when it is played to see if it's the same note
                    as the one you're singing.</p></li>
                <li><p><b>Repeat:</b> The
                    internalisation exercises move through all 12 keys, so repeat this
                    process in each of them to see how well you've internalised the
                    sound of each scale degree.</p></li>
            </ol>
            <p>Once you can pass
                an internalisation test (sing the target scale degree correctly 10
                out of 12 times), move onto the next internalisation exercise.
            </p>
            <p>
                Repeat
                this until you've passed the first 4 internalisation tests. Then
                you're read to add the recognition exercises to your practice
                routine.</p>
