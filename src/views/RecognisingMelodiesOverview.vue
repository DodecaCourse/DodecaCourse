            <h1>3. Recognising Melodies</h1>
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>In the first two
                modules we’ve built a strong foundation for relative pitch by
                internalising the sound of each scale degree from the major scale.
                You now know the sound of the most commonly used notes in music.</p>
            <p>However,
                internalising the sound of each of these notes isn’t enough to
                start recognising complete passages easily by ear. This is because
                melodies often move too quickly. When melodies start to speed up
                there are too many notes flying by for us to pick the scale degree of
                each, one at a time.</p>
            <p>There’s no
                reason for despair however, because there is a simple solution: start
                grouping those notes together.</p>
            <p>If you focus on
                grouping notes together you will being to develop a vocabulary of 2-4
                note melodic groupings. This vocabulary allows us to recognise the
                notes in melodies, even very fast ones.</p>
            <p>In this module
                we'll use 2 note recognition exercises to develop this vocabulary.
                These exercises are an extension of the ones you used in the previous
                module.</p>
            <p>This module works
                a little differently to the previous two. As you’ll notice, the
                target for the module is only to practice these exercises for 7 days,
                then to move on.</p>
            <p>That doesn’t
                mean you’re expected to master it in only 7 days, in fact it’s
                the complete opposite. The best approach to these exercises is to
                incorporate them into your practice routine and then move onto the
                next module while you continue to practice them.</p>
            <p>Developing speed
                with your relative pitch is a lot like developing speed on your
                instrument: it takes time to develop. Just as you practice technical
                exercises regularly if you want to speed up your fingers, you can
                practice with these exercises regularly alongside the exercises from
                the next module to develop speed of recognition as quickly as
                possible.</p>
            <p>So
                continue onto the exercise explanations and get started! In a week
                you can then move onto module 4 while you continue practicing these.</p>
