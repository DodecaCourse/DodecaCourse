            <h1>4. Recognising Chords</h1>
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Equipped with the exercises from the previous module you can now develop speed and
                accuracy so you can recognise melodic passages.</p>
            <p>A chord is defined by two features:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><p>The scale degree of it’s root note
                </p></li>
                <li><p>The quality of the chord (major, minor, dominant 7 etc)
                </p></li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                This is true for any chord, whether we’re talking about the tonic chord (about as simple as it gets)
                or a b9#11 chord built on the flattened second scale degree (not simple at all!).
            </p>
            <p>
                To identify a chord by ear all you need to do is identify the scale of the chord’s root note and the
                quality of the chord.
            </p>
            <p>
                Whenever you hear a chord you will be able to recognise it if you can:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li><p>
                    Identify which note is the root note (A chord always has at least 3 notes. It’s impossible to
                    identify the scale degree of the root note if you don’t know which one it is. So first you need to
                    be able to identify a chord’s root note.)
                </p></li>
                <li><p>
                    Identify the scale degree of the root note
                </p></li>
                <li><p>
                    Identify the quality of the chord
                </p></li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                If you hear a chord and can’t recognise it, you’ll find that one of these three steps is stopping you.
            </p>
            <p>
                In this module you’ll work on them separately, and then combine them all together.
            </p>
            <p>
                The targeting tones exercises focus on the first step, the chord quality exercises focus on the last and
                the diatonic chords exercises focus on putting them all together. (We can leave the second step as
                you’ve been focusing on scale degrees in the previous modules).
            </p>
            <p>
                Read how to use each of these exercises and then incorporate them into your practice schedule alongside
                the exercises from module 3.
            </p>
            <p>
                As you'll see, there is a wider selection of exercises in this module. This variety allows you to
                approach them in a new way.
            </p>
            <p>Select one exercise and focus on it until you:</p>
            <h4>1. Complete it</h4>
            <p>
                In this case, simply move onto another exercise.
            </p>
            <h4>2. Stop feeling like you're making progress, get bored with it or get frustrated</h4>
            <p>
                All of these exercises are related and often a problem with one can be solved by leaving it and focusing
                on another.
            </p>
            <p>
                So if this happens, consult the troubleshooting section or ask for help. There's a good chance you can
                actually move onto a different exercise. As you start making progress on one of the other steps in the
                process for recognising chords you'll often resolve a problem in another one.
