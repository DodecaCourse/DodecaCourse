            <h2>Individual Note Recognition Exercises</h2>
            <h3></h3>
            <p>
                You'll find recognition exercises in every module of 80/20 Ear
                Training from here on in. The idea behind recognition exercises is
                simple: listen to a sound that you've internalised and try to
                recognise what it is. Shortly after you've heard it played you'll be
                told what it was so you can check to see if you got it right.</p>
            <p>By repeatedly
                practicing recognising the sounds you're working on you can easily
                develop confidence and speed of recognition - which will allow you to
                start identifying these sounds in music when you're listening and
                playing.</p>
            <p>The recognition
                exercises in this module focus on recognising individual notes using
                their scale degrees.</p>
            <p>In the first 2
                bars a I - IV - V progression is played. After that an individual
                note is played every few seconds. After each note there is a pause of
                a few seconds, then the scale degree of the note is said.</p>
            <p>Additionally there
                is a pedal played throughout the exercise. The pedal is the tonic and
                fifth scale degree played every 8 bars. This makes it easy to keep
                the sound of the tonic firmly in your head so you'll always hear each
                note in relation to it.</p>

                the first 24 bars of a recognition exercise:</p>

            <h3>How to use the individual note recognition exercises</h3>
            <p>
                Follow the steps below for the recognition exercises:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><p><b>Listen to the
                    I - IV - V Progression:</b> Simply listening to the I - IV - V
                    progression will make it clear to your ear which note is the tonic
                    (even if you can't identify which note it is yet). So just sit back
                    and listen.</p></li>
                <li><p><b>Listen to the
                    note played after the I - IV - V Progression:</b> Listen to the note and
                    listen for the way that is sounds and resonates in relation to the
                    tonic chord/pedal.</p></li>
                <li><p><b>[OPTIONAL] Sing
                    the note:</b> singing the note helps to hear the way that it relates to
                    the tonic and often helps to make it easier to identify.</p></li>
                <li><p><b>Try to
                    recognise the note's scale degree:</b> if you think you've identified
                    the note's scale degree, say it out loud.</p></li>
                <li><p><b>Check that
                    you've identified it correctly:</b> when the name of the scale degree is
                    said you can check to see that you identified it correctly.</p></li>
            </ol>
            <p>Repeat this
                throughout the exercise.</p>
            <p>Note that step 3
                is optional. Insert it when you first begin with the recognition
                exercises but with time you will rely less and less on singing the
                note recognise it's scale degree. If you think you may be able to
                identify a note's scale degree without singing, attempt to do so.
                Recognition without singing is the end goal with these exercises.</p>
            <p>The recognition
                tests are split up into the pentatonic scale and the major scale.
                Once you've internalised scale degrees 1, 2, 3, 5 and 6 begin on the
                pentatonic scale recognition tests. Then practice with these until
                you pass the final two internalisation tests. Once you've done this
                you're ready to move onto the major scale recognition tests</p>
