                    <p>In this module
                        we’ll lay the foundation for fast, effective ear training. You’ll:</p>

                        <li>discover the
                            note that acts as the focal point of Ear Training HQ’s entire
                            approach to ear training (and the focal point of all effective ear
                            training approaches) - called the tonic.

                    <h2>The tonic</h2>
                    <p>
                        The tonic is the central note of a piece of music. It sounds the most
                        stable and at rest. The tonic is generally played at the end of a
                        piece of music to give it a sense of resolution and acts as the
                        reference point for the key of a piece of music: the tonic of a piece
                        in the key of A major is A.</p>
                    <p>The tonic is the
                        essential starting point for ear training because of that stable
                        sound it has. With a little practice we can learn to identify the
                        tonic when we hear it in music and then we can use it as a reference
                        point to identify every other note and chord we hear.</p>
                    <p>Once you’re able
                        to identify the tonic you can start learning to identify other notes
                        and chords based on the interval that separates them from the tonic.
                        But we’ll get to that in the next module.</p>
                    <p>First we need to
                        be able to confidently identify which note is the tonic. And that’s
                        precisely the goal of this first module of the Ear Training HQ
                        method.</p>
                    <p>We’ll
                        do that with an exercise called an internalisation exercise.</p>
                    <h2>Tonic Internalisation Exercise</h2>
                    <p>
                        The tonic internalisation exercise makes it as easy as possible for
                        you to 'internalise' (memorise) the sound of the tonic.</p>
                    <p>It does this by
                        clearly playing the tonic repeatedly. With this repeated exposure you
                        will quickly start to remember the sound of the tonic.</p>
                    <p>The exercise is
                        made up of a 10 bar sequence, which is repeated throughout the
                        exercise. Hit play below to listen to this 10 bar sequence.</p>
                    <p>
                    </p>
                    <p>The diagram below
                        shows this 10 bar sequence, taken from the tonic internalisation
                        exercise.</p>
                    <p>

                    </p>
                    <p>10 Bar Sequence
                        from Tonic Internalisation Exercise</p>
                    <p>
                        The
                        sequence is split up into two sections, as follows:</p>
                    <h4>
                        <b>Bars
                            1-2: Establish one note as the tonic</b></h4>
                    <p>
                        In
                        the first two bars, a short chord progression is played (called a I -
                        IV - V progression). This chord progression clearly establishes a
                        single note as the tonic. It's impossible to internalise the sound of
                        the tonic if it isn't clearly present, so you'll become very familiar
                        with it as your progress through 80/20 Ear Training as it's used at
                        the beginning of a lot of exercises!</p>
                    <h4>
                        <b>Bars
                            3-10: The tonic is played repeatedly</b></h4>
                    <p>
                        In
                        the 8 bars that follow, the tonic is played in each bar and the tonic
                        chord is played in every second bar.</p>
                    <h4>
                        <b>The
                            Sequence Repeats</b></h4>
                    <p>
                        After
                        the 10 bar sequence, the entire sequence is repeated in a new key.
                        The diagram below shows the first 30 bars of the tonic
                        internalisation exercise, and in it you can see that in bar 11, a new
                        key is outlined, this time F major. Every 10 bars, the key moves up
                        by a perfect 4th (the 4th scale degree of the old key becomes the
                        tonic of the new key.)</p>
                    <p><img src="/img/m1_30barsequence.png" alt="30 bar sequence"/>
                    </p>
                    <p>First
                        30 Bars of Tonic Internalisation Exercise</p>
                    <p>
                        It can be helpful to download and listen to the exercise while you
                        read the instructions. The exercise is repetitive (by design!) so
                        take your time to listen to it and read the instructions to make sure
                        you have a clear understanding of how to use the exercise.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><p><b>Listen to the
                            I - IV - V Progression:</b> Simply listening to the I - IV - V
                            progression will make it clear to your ear which note is the tonic
                            (even if you can't identify which note it is yet). So just sit back
                            and listen.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><p><b>Focus your
                            attention on the tonic:</b> for the following 8 bars, listen closely to
                            the tonic that is played as the highest note. Listen to it's stable
                            sound.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><p><b>Sing the
                            tonic:</b> alongside listening to the sound of the tonic, singing it
                            will help you to really hear and internalise it's stable sound.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><p><b>Repeat:</b> when
                            the I - IV - V progression is played in a new key, listen to the
                            progression as you did the first time. This will establish a new
                            note as the tonic and then you can repeat listening to/singing the
                            new tonic.</p>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Practice with this
                        exercise until you start to feel confident that you are internalising
                        the sound of the tonic, or for 3 days (whichever comes first). Then
                        try the tonic internalisation test.</p>
                    <p>That's it! It
                        sounds deceptively simple but you'll be surprised at how effective
                        this technique is.</p>
                    <p>And
                        because of it's deceptive simplicity, many musicians try to
                        complicate things. So here are a few things to avoid:</p>
                    <h3><b>What not to do with the tonic internalisation exercise</b></h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li><p>
                            DO NOT keep track of the notes/keys: the aim of this exercise is to
                            be able to hear a piece of music and identify (and sing) which note
                            is the tonic. But we aren't trying to say whether that note is a C
                            or an F# (that would be the realm of perfect pitch). Simply listen
                            and sing, with no regard for what the actual notes/keys are.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><p>DO NOT try to
                            work out the tonic during the I - IV - V progression: it takes a few
                            moments for our ears to clearly identify a new tonic. We use the I -
                            IV - V progression to make it clear, so wait until after the
                            progression to start actively listening for the tonic. Trying to do
                            it earlier simply makes things more confusing and challenging, with
                            no extra benefit.</p>
                        </li>

                    <p>Fortunately, we
                        have you covered!</p>
                    <p>While many people
                        believe that you can’t fix bad pitch, we know that you can and
                        we’ll prove it to you
                    </p>
                    <p>So navigate to the

                        Once you’ve spent a week or so on that exercise your singing will
                        be at a level where you’re ready to start on the internalisation

                    <p>“I’m not sure

                    <p>In the
                        internalisation exercise the tonic is always the top note.</p>
                    <p>So if you’re
                        unsure whether you’re singing the correct note you can use the
                        exercises in the bonus module “How to Sing the Top Note of a Chord”
                        to improve your ability to hear and sing the top note of a chord.
                        That exercise will make it easy for you to know when you’re singing
                        the correct note in the internalisation exercise and when you’re
                        singing a different note from the chord.</p>

                    <p>If the tonic is
                        played outside your range you can sing it an octave higher or lower
                        than it is sounded.</p>
                    <p>Transposing it by
                        an octave gives you all the benefits of singing it in the octave that
                        you hear it in, with the added benefit of improving your ability to
                        identify high/low passages in music.</p>

                        internalisation test can be broken down into 3 sections:</p>
                    <p>Bars 1-2:
                        Establish one note as the tonic</p>
                    <p>Just like in the
                        internalisation exercise, a note is established as the tonic using
                        the I - IV - V progression.</p>
                    <p>Bars 3-6: Pause</p>
                    <p>During the
                        following 4 bars, there is a pause. This is where the testing takes
                        place. You'll find out how in the next section.</p>
                    <p>Bars 7-8: The
                        tonic is played</p>
                    <p>In the final 2
                        bars of the sequence, the tonic is played. It is repeated in three
                        octaves, so that it will match your register, regardless of your
                        range.</p>
                    <p>Sequence Repeats:
                        The 8 bar sequence is repeated in a new key. Like in the
                        internalisation exercises, the key centre moves up by a perfect 4th
                        each time: the fourth scale degree of the old key is the tonic of the
                        new one. The diagram below shows the first 24 bars of the tonic
                        internalisation test:</p>

                        Download and listen to listen to the tonic internalisation test
                        while you read the instructions.</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li><p>Listen to the
                            I - IV - V Progression: Like with the internalisation exercises (and
                            all other exercises in the course) just listen to the I - IV - V
                            progression while it outlines the key.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><p>Listen for
                            the sound of the tonic and hear it clearly in your head: wait until
                            the I - IV - V progression has been played and you hear the tonic
                            chord played again, then see if you can hear internally which note
                            is the tonic. Try to hear it as clearly as you can in your head.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><p>Sing the
                            tonic: Sing the note you hear as the tonic in your head. If you
                            can't hold it for the entire duration of the pause, stop and take a
                            breath, then sing it again until you hear the tonic played.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><p>Check that
                            you have sung the target scale degree correctly: Listen to the tonic
                            when it is played to see if it's the same note as the one you're
                            singing.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><p>Repeat: The
                            tonic internalisation exercise moves through all 12 keys, so repeat
                            this process in each of them to see how well you've internalised the
                            sound of the tonic.</p>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Try the entire
                        test, and see how you go.</p>
                    <p>If you sang the
                        tonic correctly in 10, 11 or all 12 keys congratulations, you've
                        passed the first module of 80/20 Ear Training! You've taken an
                        incredibly important step on the road to relative pitch and more
                        creativity and confidence with music.</p>
                    <p>If you didn't,
                        there's no need to worry. It takes most of our students at least a
                        few attempts to pass this test. Simply go back to the internalisation
                        exercise to solidify your ability to recognise the sound of the tonic
                        and retry after a few more practice sessions. Make sure you check the
                        troubleshooting section if you have any specific problems.</p>
