            <h1>2. Recognising Individual Notes</h1>
            <h2>Test</h2>
            <p>
                Each scale degree has an internalisation test that goes alongside
                it's internalisation exercise.</p>
            <p>The
                internalisation test for each scale degree is just like the
                internalisation test for the tonic from the first module. A I - IV -V
                progression is played for the first two bars, followed by a pause,
                and finally the target scale degree is played before the sequence is
                repeated in a new key.</p>
            <p>You can see the
                first 8 bars from the internalisation test for the second scale
                degree below.</p>

            </p>
            <p>
                In the internalisation tests in this module we'll add the additional
                step of singing the tonic, just as we did with the internalisation
                exercises.</p>
            <p>This creates two
                'difficulty levels' with the internalisation tests.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><p>Sing the
                    tonic</p></li>
            </ol>
            <p>In this first
                'difficulty level', you'll sing the tonic before you attempt to sing
                the target scale degree. So you will:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><p>Listen to the
                    I - IV - V Progression: Like with the internalisation exercises (and
                    all other exercises in the course) just listen to the I - IV - V
                    progression while it outlines the key.</p></li>
                <li><p>Listen for
                    the sound of the target scale degree and hear it clearly in your
                    head: wait until the I - IV - V progression has been played and you
                    hear the tonic chord played again, then identify which note is the
                    tonic and hear it internally.</p></li>
                <li><p>Sing the
                    tonic: sing the note you hear as the tonic in your head just as you
                    did in the tonic internalisation exercise.</p></li>
                <li><p>Try to hear
                    the sound of the target scale degree clearly in your head: after
                    you've sung the tonic, try to hear the sound of the target scale
                    degree as clearly in your head as you can. You are repeating the
                    movement from the tonic to the target scale degree you've been
                    singing in the internalisation exercise so listen for that sound.</p></li>
                <li><p>Sing the
                    target scale degree: if you can hear the target scale degree
                    internally, sing it. Then hold it or repeat it for the next few
                    second.</p></li>
                <li><p>Check that
                    you have sung the target scale degree correctly: Listen to the
                    target scale degree when it is played to see if it's the same note
                    as the one you're singing.</p></li>
                <li><p>Repeat: The
                    internalisation tests move through all 12 keys, so repeat this
                    process in each of them to see how well you've internalised the
                    sound of each scale degree.</p></li>
            </ol>
            <p>Once you can get
                10 out of 12 keys right at the first difficult level, you're ready to
                move onto the second one.</p>
            <ol start="2">
                <li><p>Don't sing
                    the tonic</p></li>
            </ol>
            <ol>
                <li><p>Listen to the
                    I - IV - V Progression: Like with the internalisation exercises (and
                    all other exercises in the course) just listen to the I - IV - V
                    progression while it outlines the key.</p></li>
                <li><p>Listen for
                    the sound of the tonic and hear it clearly in your head: wait until
                    the I - IV - V progression has been played and you hear the tonic
                    chord played again, then identify which note is the tonic and hear
                    it internally.</p></li>
                <li><p>Try to hear
                    the sound of the target scale degree clearly in your head: once you
                    can hear the tonic clearly in your head, listen for the sound of the
                    target scale degree. You are listening for the same relationship,
                    but you simply haven't sung the tonic.</p></li>
                <li><p>Sing the
                    target scale degree: if you can hear the target scale degree
                    internally, sing it. Then hold it or repeat it for the next few
                    second.</p></li>
                <li><p>Check that
                    you have sung the target scale degree correctly: Listen to the
                    target scale degree when it is played to see if it's the same note
                    as the one you're singing.</p></li>
                <li><p>Repeat: The
                    internalisation exercises move through all 12 keys, so repeat this
                    process in each of them to see how well you've internalised the
                    sound of each scale degree.</p></li>
            </ol>
            <p>Once you can pass
                an internalisation test (sing the target scale degree correctly 10
                out of 12 times), move onto the next internalisation exercise. Repeat
                this until you've passed the first 4 internalisation tests. Then
                you're read to add the recognition exercises to your practice
                routine.</p>

            <p>
                You'll find recognition exercises in every module of 80/20 Ear
                Training from here on in. The idea behind recognition exercises is
                simple: listen to a sound that you've internalised and try to
                recognise what it is. Shortly after you've heard it played you'll be
                told what it was so you can check to see if you got it right.</p>
            <p>By repeatedly
                practicing recognising the sounds you're working on you can easily
                develop confidence and speed of recognition - which will allow you to
                start identifying these sounds in music when you're listening and
                playing.</p>
            <p>The recognition
                exercises in this module focus on recognising individual notes using
                their scale degrees.</p>
            <p>In the first 2
                bars a I - IV - V progression is played. After that an individual
                note is played every few seconds. After each note there is a pause of
                a few seconds, then the scale degree of the note is said.</p>
            <p>Additionally there
                is a pedal played throughout the exercise. The pedal is the tonic and
                fifth scale degree played every 8 bars. This makes it easy to keep
                the sound of the tonic firmly in your head so you'll always hear each
                note in relation to it.</p>
            <p>Below you can see
                the first 24 bars of a recognition exercise:</p>
            <p><img src="/img/m2_24bars.png" alt="24 bars"/>
            </p>
            <p><br/>

            </p>
            <p>
                Follow the steps below for the recognition exercises:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><p>Listen to the
                    I - IV - V Progression: Simply listening to the I - IV - V
                    progression will make it clear to your ear which note is the tonic
                    (even if you can't identify which note it is yet). So just sit back
                    and listen.</p></li>
                <li><p>Listen to the
                    note played after the I - IV - V Progression: Listen to the note and
                    listen for the way that is sounds and resonates in relation to the
                    tonic chord/pedal.</p></li>
                <li><p>[OPTIONAL]Sing
                    the note: singing the note helps to hear the way that it relates to
                    the tonic and often helps to make it easier to identify.</p></li>
                <li><p>Try to
                    recognise the note's scale degree: if you think you've identified
                    the note's scale degree, say it out loud.</p></li>
                <li><p>Check that
                    you've identified it correctly: when the name of the scale degree is
                    said you can check to see that you identified it correctly.</p></li>
            </ol>
            <p>Repeat this
                throughout the exercise.</p>
            <p>Note that step 3
                is optional. Insert it when you first begin with the recognition
                exercises but with time you will rely less and less on singing the
                note recognise it's scale degree. If you think you may be able to
                identify a note's scale degree without singing, attempt to do so.
                Recognition without singing is the end goal with these exercises.</p>
            <p>The recognition
                tests are split up into the pentatonic scale and the major scale.
                Once you've internalised scale degrees 1, 2, 3, 5 and 6 begin on the
                pentatonic scale recognition tests. Then practice with these until
                you pass the final two internalisation tests. Once you've done this
                you're ready to move onto the major scale recognition tests</p>
            <p>There are 10
                recognition tests for each scale. The first 5 are at a slower tempo,
                the final 5 are at a faster tempo. Focus on the slower tempo until
                you can complete an exercise with less than 5 mistakes. Then move
                onto the faster tempo exercises.</p>
