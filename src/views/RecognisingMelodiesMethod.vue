            <h1>3. Recognising Melodies</h1>
            <h2>Method</h2>
            <p>
                These exercises are just like the internalisation exercise from the
                first module. The 2 note melody recognition exercises are just like
                the individual note recognition exercises from the previous module.</p>
            <p>A
                I - IV - V progression is played at the start to establish one note
                as the tonic, and then the exercise begins. Instead of hearing one
                note at a time, two are played - one straight after the other - then
                there is a pause of a few seconds, then you're told the scale degrees
                of the two notes.</p>
            <h3>How the exercises are organised</h3>
            <p>
                You'll see below that there is a large selection of 2 Note Melody
                Recognition Exercises. There are 120 of them in total, split up into
                four groups: 2nds &amp; 3rds , 4ths &amp; 5ths, 6ths &amp; 8ves and
                melodic intervals. The first 3 groups contain melodies of specific
                intervals: in the 2nds &amp; 3rds exercises for example there is
                always either a 2nd or 3rd between the two notes of the melody. The
                final group contains all the intervals from the previous exercises.</p>
            <p>In each group
                you'll find 30 exercises in total. They are each labelled with two
                numbers (1-1 for example). The first number tells you the speed:
                exercise 1-X is at the slowest speed, exercise 5-X is at the fastest.
                There are 5 variations at each speed, and the second number tells you
                that.</p>
            <p>If
                you start to memorise the order of some of the melodies in any given
                exercise, continue onto the next variation.</p>
            <h3>How to use the 2 Note Melody Recognition Exercises?</h3>
            <p>
                The approach for these recognition exercises is identical to the
                approach for the individual note recognition exercises from the
                previous module:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><p>Listen to the
                    I - IV - V Progression: Simply listening to the I - IV - V
                    progression will make it clear to your ear which note is the tonic
                    (even if you can't identify which note it is yet). So just sit back
                    and listen.</p></li>
                <li><p>Listen to the
                    2 note melody played after the I - IV - V Progression: Listen to the
                    2 notes and listen for the way that they each sound and resonate in
                    relation to the tonic chord/pedal.</p></li>
                <li><p>[OPTIONAL]Sing
                    the notes: singing the notes helps to hear the way that they relate
                    to the tonic and often helps to make them easier to identify. Sing
                    and hold each note for a little longer than you hear them if
                    necessary.</p></li>
                <li><p>Try to
                    recognise the note's scale degree: if you think you've identified
                    the note's scale degree, say it out loud.</p></li>
                <li><p>Check that
                    you've identified it correctly: when the name of the scale degree is
                    said you can check to see that you identified it correctly.</p></li>
            </ol>
            <p>Repeat
                steps 2-5 throughout the exercise.</p>
            <h3>How to choose which exercises to focus on</h3>
            <p>
                Start with the 2nds &amp; 3rds, exercise 1. Focus on just this
                exercise (and it's variations) until you can complete it with less
                than 5 mistakes.</p>
            <p>When you can do
                this, move onto 4ths &amp; 5ths, exercise 1.</p>
            <p>Continue to move
                through all exercise groups until you can complete the melodic
                intervals exercise at the slowest speed. Then move onto exercise 2
                for 2nds &amp; 3rds. Slowly make your way through all the exercises
                until you can complete them all at the fastest speed.</p>
