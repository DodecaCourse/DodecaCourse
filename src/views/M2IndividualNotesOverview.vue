            <h1>2. Recognising Individual Notes</h1>
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>This module gives
                you the tools you need to identify any given note. You’ll:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>discover the
                    system that we use in this course - called scale degrees - to
                    identify any note we hear
                </li>
                <li>
                    be introduced to a singable naming system for those scale degrees - Solfège
                </li>
                <li>internalise the
                    unique sound of the remaining six notes of the major scale
                </li>
                <li>practice recognising individual notes until you can confidently
                    recognise each one when you hear it
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Method</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><p>
                    Read the lesson on scale degrees to learn about the system you’ll
                    use to recognise each note as you develop relative pitch.</p></li>
                <li><p>Continue to
                    the lessons on individual note internalisation exercises, individual
                    note internalisation tests and recognition exercises. We’ll add an
                    additional step to the internalisation exercises and tests in this
                    module so make sure you read the lesson to find out what it is.</p></li>
                <li><p>Practice one
                    internalisation exercise until you can pass the corresponding test.</p></li>
                <li><p>Repeat this
                    with all the scale degrees from the pentatonic scale (2, 3, 5 and
                    6).</p></li>
                <li><p>Add the
                    pentatonic scale recognition exercises to your practice routine.</p></li>
                <li><p>Split your
                    practice sessions between the pentatonic scale recognition exercises
                    and the final two internalisation exercises until you can pass the
                    internalisation tests and get over 80% on the recognition exercises.</p></li>
                <li><p>Focus
                    on the major scale recognition exercises until you reach the target
                    for the module.</p></li>
