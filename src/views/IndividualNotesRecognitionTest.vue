            <h2>Recognition Tests</h2>
            <p>There are 10
                recognition tests for each scale. The first 5 are at a slower tempo,
                the final 5 are at a faster tempo. Focus on the slower tempo until
                you can complete an exercise with less than 5 mistakes. Then move
                onto the faster tempo exercises.</p>
