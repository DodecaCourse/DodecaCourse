            <h1>3. Recognising Melodies</h1>
            <h2>2 Note Melody Recognition Exercises</h2>
            <p>
                These exercises are just like the internalisation exercise from the
                first module. The 2 note melody recognition exercises are just like
                the individual note recognition exercises from the previous module.</p>
            <p>A
                <i>I - IV - V - I</i> progression is played at the start to establish one note
                as the tonic, and then the exercise begins. Instead of hearing one
                note at a time, two are played - one straight after the other - then
                there is a pause where you can enter the scale degrees you heard.</p>
            <h3>How the exercises are organised</h3>
            <p>
                You'll see below that there is a large selection of 2 Note Melody
                Recognition Exercises. There are 120 of them in total, split up into
                four groups: 2nds &amp; 3rds , 4ths &amp; 5ths, 6ths &amp; 8ves and
                melodic intervals. The first 3 groups contain melodies of specific
                intervals: in the 2nds &amp; 3rds exercises for example there is
                always either a 2nd or 3rd between the two notes of the melody. The
                final group contains all the intervals from the previous exercises.</p>
            <p>In each group you'll find 5 levels with varying speed, so start at level one
                and advance to the higher levels as you acquire speed in recognition.

            <h3>How to use the 2 Note Melody Recognition Exercises?</h3>
            <p>
                The approach for these recognition exercises is identical to the
                approach for the individual note recognition exercises from the
                previous module:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><p><b>Listen to the
                    <i>I - IV - V - I</i> progression:</b> Simply listening to the <i>I - IV - V - I</i>
                    progression will make it clear to your ear which note is the tonic
                    (even if you can't identify which note it is yet). So just sit back
                    and listen.</p></li>
                <li><p><b>Listen to the
                    2 note melody played after the <i>I - IV - V - I</i> progression:</b> Listen to the
                    2 notes and listen for the way that they each sound and resonate in
                    relation to the tonic chord/pedal.</p></li>
                <li><p><b>[OPTIONAL] Sing
                    the notes:</b> singing the notes helps to hear the way that they relate
                    to the tonic and often helps to make them easier to identify. Sing
                    and hold each note for a little longer than you hear them if
                    necessary.</p></li>
                <li><p><b>Try to
                    recognise the notes' scale degrees:</b> if you think you've identified
                    the notes' scale degrees, sing them with their corresponding solf√®ge syllables.</p></li>
                <li><p><b>Check that
                    you've identified it correctly:</b> Enter them by clicking the corresponding buttons on
                    the circle to check if you identified them correctly.</p></li>
            </ol>
            <p>Repeat
                steps 2-5 throughout the exercise.</p>
            <h3>How to choose which exercises to focus on</h3>
            <p>
                Start with the 2nds &amp; 3rds, level 1. Focus on just this
                exercise until you can pass the test with less
                than 5 mistakes.</p>
            <p>When you can do
                this, move onto 4ths &amp; 5ths, level 1.</p>
            <p>Continue to move
                through all exercise groups until you can complete the melodic
                intervals exercise at the slowest speed. Then move onto level 2
                for 2nds &amp; 3rds. Slowly make your way through all the exercises
                until you can complete them all at the fastest speed.</p>
