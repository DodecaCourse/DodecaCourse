        3. Recognising Melodies
      </h1>
      <h2>2 Note Melody Recognition</h2>
      <p>
        These exercises are just like the internalisation exercise from the
        first module. The 2 note melody recognition exercises are just like
        the individual note recognition exercises from the previous module.
      </p>
      <p>
        A
        <i>I - IV - V - I</i> progression is played at the start to establish one note
        as the tonic, and then the exercise begins. Instead of hearing one
        note at a time, two are played - one straight after the other - then
        there is a pause where you can enter the scale degrees you heard.
      </p>
      <h3>How the exercises are organised</h3>
      <p>
        You'll see below that there are several 2 Note Melody
        Recognition Exercises: 2nds &amp; 3rds , 4ths &amp; 5ths, 6ths &amp; 8ves and
        melodic intervals. The first 3 groups contain melodies of specific
        intervals: in the 2nds &amp; 3rds exercises for example there is
        always either a 2nd or 3rd between the two notes of the melody. The
        final group contains all the intervals from the previous exercises.
      </p>
      <p>
        In each group you'll find 5 levels with varying speed, so start at level one
        and advance to the higher levels as you acquire speed in recognition.
      </p>
      <h3>How to use the 2 Note Melody Recognition Exercises?</h3>
      <p>
        The approach for these recognition exercises is identical to the
        approach for the individual note recognition exercises from the
        previous module:
      </p>

        <v-stepper
          v-model="curStep"
          vertical
          class="explanation-stepper"
        >
          <v-stepper-step
            :complete="curStep > 1"
            step="1"
          >
            <span>Listen to the <i>I - IV - V - I</i> progression</span>
          </v-stepper-step>
          <v-stepper-content step="1">
            <v-card>
              <v-card-text>
                Simply listening to the <i>I - IV - V - I</i>
                progression will make it clear to your ear which note is the tonic
                (even if you can't identify which note it is yet). So just sit back
                and listen.

                Singing the notes helps to hear the way that they relate
                to the tonic and often helps to make them easier to identify. Sing
                and hold each note for a little longer than you hear them if
                necessary.

      <h3>How to choose which exercises to focus on</h3>
      <p>
        Start with the 2nds &amp; 3rds, level 1. Focus on just this
        exercise until you can pass the test with less
        than 5 mistakes.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you can do
        this, move onto 4ths &amp; 5ths, level 1.
      </p>
      <p>
        Continue to move
        through all exercise groups until you can complete the melodic
        intervals exercise at the slowest speed. Then move onto level 2
        for 2nds &amp; 3rds. Slowly make your way through all the exercises
        until you can complete them all at the fastest speed.
