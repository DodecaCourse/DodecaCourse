      <h2>Get Playing</h2>
      <p>
        Having finished the Dodeca course, you probably acquired a whole new feeling
        for each scale degree. You've come far already, but you're still at the
        beginning of your journey, as there's a lot more to discover. How does the feeling
        of a scale degree change when you hold it over a chord progression? Do you feel
        it needs to resolve and if yes, in which direction?
      </p>
      <p>
        Try to improvise, either over a pedal or over chord changes, while being
        conscious which scale degree you are playing at the moment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Play your favourite tunes and try to understand why the melody works so well in this
        specific harmonic environment, which tones and phrases you like the most and why.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a special form of improvisation, you could write down some lines you like with
        their chord changes, transpose them to be in the same key and use them as a base
        for a small composition, trying if the lines still work when changing some of the notes
        and giving them your personal touch.
      </p>
      <p>
        You see, the possibilities are nearly endless, so play around, discover, be creative
        and, most importantly, have fun!
