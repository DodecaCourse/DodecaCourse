            <h2>The tonic</h2>
            <p>
                The tonic is the central note of a piece of music. It sounds the most
                stable and at rest. The tonic is generally played at the end of a
                piece of music to give it a sense of resolution and acts as the
                reference point for the key of a piece of music: the tonic of a piece
                in the key of A major is A.</p>
            <p>The tonic is the
                essential starting point for ear training because of that stable
                sound it has. With a little practice we can learn to identify the
                tonic when we hear it in music and then we can use it as a reference
                point to identify every other note and chord we hear.</p>
            <p>Once you’re able
                to identify the tonic you can start learning to identify other notes
                and chords based on the interval that separates them from the tonic.
                But we’ll get to that in the next module.</p>
            <p>First we need to
                be able to confidently identify which note is the tonic. And that’s
                precisely the goal of this first module.</p>
            <p>We’ll
                do that with an exercise called an internalisation exercise.</p>
            <h2>Tonic Internalisation Exercise</h2>
            <p>
                The tonic internalisation exercise makes it as easy as possible for
                you to 'internalise' (memorise) the sound of the tonic.</p>
            <p>It does this by
                clearly playing the tonic repeatedly. With this repeated exposure you
                will quickly start to remember the sound of the tonic.</p>
            <p>The exercise is
                made up of a 10 bar sequence, which is repeated throughout the
                exercise. Hit play below to listen to this 10 bar sequence.</p>
            <p>
            </p>
            <p>The diagram below
                shows this 10 bar sequence, taken from the tonic internalisation
                exercise.</p>
            <v-img contain max-height="18ch"
                   max-width="90vw"
                   src="/img/m1_10barsequence.png" title="10 Bar Sequence from Tonic Internalisation Exercise" v-on="on"/>
            <p>
                The
                sequence is split up into two sections, as follows:</p>
            <h4>
                <b>Bars
                    1-2: Establish one note as the tonic</b></h4>
            <p>
                In
                the first two bars, a short chord progression is played (called a I -
                IV - V progression). This chord progression clearly establishes a
                single note as the tonic. It's impossible to internalise the sound of
                the tonic if it isn't clearly present, so you'll become very familiar
                with it as you progress through the modules as it's used at
                the beginning of a lot of exercises!</p>
            <h4>
                <b>Bars
                    3-10: The tonic is played repeatedly</b></h4>
            <p>
                In
                the 8 bars that follow, the tonic is played in each bar and the tonic
                chord is played in every second bar.</p>
            <h4>
                <b>The
                    Sequence Repeats</b></h4>
            <p>
                After
                the 10 bar sequence, the entire sequence is repeated in a new randomly chosen key.
                The diagram below shows the first 30 bars of the tonic
                internalisation exercise, and in it you can see that in bar 11, a new
                key is outlined, this time F major.</p>
            <v-img contain max-height="54ch"
                   max-width="90vw" src="/img/m1_30barsequence.png"
                   title="First 30 Bars of Tonic Internalisation Exercise"/>
            <p>
                It can be helpful to already start the player and listen to the exercise while you
                read the instructions. The exercise is repetitive (by design!) so
                take your time to listen to it and read the instructions to make sure
                you have a clear understanding of how to use the exercise.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><p><b>Listen to the
                    I - IV - V Progression:</b> Simply listening to the I - IV - V
                    progression will make it clear to your ear which note is the tonic
                    (even if you can't identify which note it is yet). So just sit back
                    and listen.</p>
                </li>
                <li><p><b>Focus your
                    attention on the tonic:</b> for the following 8 bars, listen closely to
                    the tonic that is played as the highest note. Listen to it's stable
                    sound.</p>
                </li>
                <li><p><b>Sing the
                    tonic:</b> alongside listening to the sound of the tonic, singing it
                    will help you to really hear and internalise it's stable sound.</p>
                </li>
                <li><p><b>Repeat:</b> when
                    the I - IV - V progression is played in a new key, listen to the
                    progression as you did the first time. This will establish a new
                    note as the tonic and then you can repeat listening to/singing the
                    new tonic.</p>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>Practice with this
                exercise until you start to feel confident that you are internalising
                the sound of the tonic, or for 3 days (whichever comes first). Then
                try the tonic internalisation test.</p>
            <p>That's it! It
                sounds deceptively simple but you'll be surprised at how effective
                this technique is.</p>
            <p>And
                because of it's deceptive simplicity, many musicians try to
                complicate things. So here are a few things to avoid:</p>
            <h3><b>What not to do with the tonic internalisation exercise</b></h3>
            <ol>
                <li><p>
                    <b>DO NOT keep track of the notes/keys:</b> the aim of this exercise is to
                    be able to hear a piece of music and identify (and sing) which note
                    is the tonic. But we aren't trying to say whether that note is a C
                    or an F# (that would be the realm of perfect pitch). Simply listen
                    and sing, with no regard for what the actual notes/keys are.</p>
                </li>
                <li><p><b>DO NOT try to
                    work out the tonic during the I - IV - V progression:</b> it takes a few
                    moments for our ears to clearly identify a new tonic. We use the I -
                    IV - V progression to make it clear, so wait until after the
                    progression to start actively listening for the tonic. Trying to do
                    it earlier simply makes things more confusing and challenging, with
                    no extra benefit.</p>

                Once you’ve spent a week or so on that exercise your singing will
                be at a level where you’re ready to start on the internalisation

            <p><b>“I’m not sure

            <p>In the
                internalisation exercise the tonic is always the top note.</p>
            <p>So if you’re
                unsure whether you’re singing the correct note you can use the
                exercises in the bonus module “How to Sing the Top Note of a Chord”
                to improve your ability to hear and sing the top note of a chord.
                That exercise will make it easy for you to know when you’re singing
                the correct note in the internalisation exercise and when you’re
                singing a different note from the chord.</p>

            <p>Transposing it by
