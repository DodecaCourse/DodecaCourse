            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>In this module
                we’ll lay the foundation for fast, effective ear training. You’ll:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>discover the
                    note that acts as the focal point of Ear Training HQ’s entire
                    approach to ear training (and the focal point of all effective ear
                    training approaches) - called the tonic.
                </li>
                <li>begin training your ears by memorising the sound of the tonic so you
                    are able to identify it in music.
                </li>
